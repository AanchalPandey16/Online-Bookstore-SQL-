# 📚 Online Bookstore SQL Project

## 📝 Project Overview

This project simulates a simple backend database for an **Online Bookstore** using **PostgreSQL**. It focuses on practicing and demonstrating core SQL concepts including:

- `SELECT` statements
- `WHERE` filtering
- `JOIN` operations
- `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- `ORDER BY` and sorting results

The database contains three main tables:
- **Books**: Stores information like title, author, genre, and price
- **Customers**: Stores customer details
- **Orders**: Records each order placed by customers
